Take a look at this beautiful dataset.
* Open the co_citation dataset in excel
Imagine that you would like to understand this dataset. Well... that won't be nice.
That's why we created Graphion. When we open the file in our app...
* Open co_citation dataset in the webapp
* Pause the video to hide the long loading screen
it looks prettier at least. You can't understand it yet, but we will show you how you can!

** TODO WAIT FOR THE ACTUAL VISUALIZATIONS AND INSERT THIS PART OF THE SCRIPT ONCE WE HAVE THEM

We have been a little rude since we still haven't introduced ourselves.
You can read it in the app
* Open the 'About us' part of the webapp
but we will tell it ourselves since everyone has to be in the video anyway.

* Let everyone briefly introduce themselves and explain briefly what they have done

* Let Anton and Sophia show the website and go through all pages except the actual visualizations.

* Tom and Sam demonstrate the node-link diagram and all its possibilities

* Let Steven and Rain demonstrate the adjacency matrix and all its possibilities

* Tim will show the dirty and fast javascript attempt

To conclude the video, we will take a look at the problems we encountered and improvements that could be made.
 ** TODO this only contains our current problems, more will be added once we encounter more problems
We ran into 2 major problems: cooperation and performance.
In order to cooperate well, all group members involved need to know exactly how the code of the others works,
which means that whenever someone adds code, the other group members need to read it carefully and find out
what it does and often ask the person who wrote it. Also, some group members are much more experienced than
others.
This often lead to the problem that team members would achieve more on their own than when they would get help.

The other problem was performance. The datasets we were given are quite big and it looks like Bokeh is not made
to handle such big datasets.

** TODO change this later
Talking about improvements in the initial video would be quite weird as we are simply not done yet. We will leave
this empty until the end of the project.

Thank you for watching this video!
