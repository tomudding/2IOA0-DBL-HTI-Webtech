Hi, I am Tom.

I am mostly responsible for making sure that what we all create is reliable and works properly together as one single tool. While the tool can be used locally, we also want it to work as a website, accessible to the greater public. This means that I am constantly working with Nginx, Flask, and Bokeh to make sure you can see our tool on a website. <sup><em>(probably show some fancy-a** server code)</em></sup> Furthermore, I also try to improve implementations where necessary. You could argue that in the end, I am Quality Assurance (QA).
