Hi, my name is Anton. 
During the first two sprints I mostly focused on the design 
and implementation of our website together with Sofia and Tom. 
This also included making the website responsive so that it would
respond to the user's device's screen size and orientation. 
The website was built by using standard tools like HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript, but no libraries have been used so far.
My tasks also included designing the user interface of the
visualization tool.
