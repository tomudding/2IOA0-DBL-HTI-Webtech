I'm Tim, I did multiple smaller tasks rather than a single big focus. My biggest task was the following:

When we were having trouble with Bokeh performance, I tried to do a quick and simple implementation of the assignment on a
javascript canvas.
This approach indeed resulted in much better performance, it was more than 20 times as fast as Bokeh although it didn't
have many features.
The big drawback of this approach was that we would have to program everything ourselves. We agreed that this was not
worth the performance benefits so we didn't continue this approach.
