Hi my name is Sam and I have been partly responsible for the implementation of the nodelink diagram. The nodelink diagram is an easy way to see how the data is connected to each other. Each data object gets a node, and every connection between the data gets a link in the form of a line. Then we put every node on a circle and draw the lines accordingly. This is done using Networkx, which provides the core of the graph encoding, bokeh  which provides the interactions and how the graph is drawn and HoloViews that combines the two.
