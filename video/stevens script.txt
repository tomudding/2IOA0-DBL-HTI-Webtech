Hello, I'm Steven and I've worked mainly on the matrix visualization.
(show a picture of the matrix visualization) This visualization is made
with Bokeh and uses the python package fastcluster to reorder the matrix.
Both a reordering and a distance metric can be chosen, and if you don't
want to reorder at all that's also possible :~). I also have experimented
with a 3D node-link diagram using the plotly library. (show on screen)
