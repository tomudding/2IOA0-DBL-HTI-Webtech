Currently, I am writing the report in Overleaf. 
In order to edit the report, you need to create a project containing all files in vgtc_journal_latex.zip, except for the file template.tex.
Also, all files in the pictures folder should be directly in your project directory instead of in the pictures folder.
The pictures folder itself should not be present in Overleaf.

I will include the pdf so far as well to spare everyone else the effort of exporting it themselves.
The current report document is just a modified copy of template.tex, I will keep modifying it until it only contains our content.
