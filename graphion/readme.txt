_______________________________________________________


## Access


1.1 Accessing the website

	Graphion's website can be accessed by going to:
	graphion.uddi.ng


1.2 Accessing the tool

### Usage


2.1 Uploading and filtering a data set

	To use the tool the user can upload a new file
	(of .csv format) or select a file that has been 
	previously uploaded. After selecting (and 
	possibly uploading) a file, the user can filter 
	it by limiting the range of edge weights, nodes' 
	in-degree and nodes' out-degree, or by clustering.
	By filtering the user can significantly improve 
	the processing time it takes to generate a 
	visualization of the given data set.

Note:   Clustering has not yet been completely implemented 
	as a filtering method. (updated on 11.06.2019)


2.2 Using the tool

	After the filtering the data set, the tool will
	be launched. It consists of 3 main components:

		a. left toolbar for modifying the 
		   visualization

		b. right toolbar for information about 
	 	   the visualization
		
		c. the visualization window located
		   between the toolbars

2.2.a Left toolbar
	
	In the left toolbar the user can change the
	visualization type of the node link diagram
	(Screen 1), reordering of the matrix (Screen 2)
	and modify the visualization with extra options.

2.2.b Right toolbar
	
	In the right toolbar the user can find all
	the information about the selected nodes.

Note:	Right tool bar has not yet been completely
	implemented. (updated on 11.06.2019)

2.2.c Visualization window

	In the visualization window the user can see
	and interact with the visualizations of the 
	uploaded data. Both visualizations (node-link
	diagram and matrix diagram) have their own 
	toolbars for interaction. These toolbars are
	located in the upper right corner of each
	visualization.
