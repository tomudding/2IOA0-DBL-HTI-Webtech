                    This paper describes a data visualization tool for in the browser. It
                    allows anyone with access to the site to upload data sets and visualize
                    them in their browser using various kinds of graphs. The tool is written
                    in Python and makes use of Bokeh and NetworkX.
                    Before explaining more about the tool, I will briefly describe what a
                    graph is.
                    Graphs consist of vertices and edges. The vertices represent the ’things’
                    the graph is about. When the graph is about people, every vertex would
                    represent a person. The edges denote the relationships between the
                    vertices. Every edge connects 2 vertices with each other. In a graph
                    where the vertices are people, the edges could for instance show which
                    people like each other.
                    This tool can be used to create node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices.
                    In a node-link diagram, the vertices are shown usually as small dots
                    and the edges are shown as lines or arrows. The vertices can be located
                    anywhere in the graph and they can often be moved around by the
                    user to make it easier to find insights. In a node-link diagram, you can
                    quickly see relations in your data set since human eyes are good at
                    seeing patterns.
                    Adjacency matrices show the vertices and graphs in a completely different
                    way. The vertices are no longer scattered across the screen, but
                    are placed on the left and top of the screen. Every vertex on top of the
                    screen has its own column and every vertex on the left of the screen has
                    its own row. Usually, all vertices appear once on the top and once on
                    the left. This way, they create some kind of table where a small place
                    is reserved for the (optional) connection between the vertex right above
                    the spot and the vertex left of the spot. These spots are usually very
                    small and are filled with a color that denotes the connection between
                    its vertices. In simple cases, black could indicate that the vertices are
                    connected and white could indicate that they are not.
                    This tool lets the user upload a data set and allows the user to view the
                    node-link diagram or adjacency matrix of that data set. These views
                    also allow several interactions with the data set to study it more in
                    depth. This paper will explain in more detail what exactly the tool is
                    capable of.
